# Igor-Pro-Data-Acquisition
I have been using Igor Pro since 2015, and whenever my lab was in need of data acquisition tools, I turned to Igor Pro and its VISA library to communicate with instruments. I am posting this online so folks could side-step the many, many hours it might take to read and implement the material in Igor Pro's manuals and these various instruments we use in our lab. 

Instruments found in this repository include at least: 
* Keithley Sourcemeter 2400
* Keithly 486 Autoranging Picoammeter
* Oriel Cornerstone Monochromator 74000

If you have any comments, questions, suggestions, reach out to me at rsfadia@ucsc.edu.
